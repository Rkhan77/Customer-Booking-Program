# RentalBooking-Program



Hello! I am excited to introduce my project to you. My project is Customer Booking Program. This project is important to me because it helped to learn how to code. I have put a lot of time and effort into this project and I hope you enjoy it. Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!

This program will prompt for and read in person’s first and the last name and prompt to read the customer’s license number. The customer’s name and license number will be stored in different variables. The program will then output the name in a prompt to input the number of days that a customer wants to hire a car. The days of hire should be declared/assumed as an integer i.e., int.
After all inputs (don’t forget to hit the Enter button on the keyboard), the program will execute and display the summary of hire including the rental.**
